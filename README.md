# App Store
Open Source App Store for Electron Apps. Bring powerful, simple, minimalist Electron/Node based GUI apps to the user.

## Roadmap

1. Super Easy Download/Install inspired by the [Portable Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application) concept.
 - Simple app-store.exe installer (or just simple executable) for Windows, Mac, and Linux Operating Systems.
2. App Store will support multiple software catalogs called feeds.
 - Users will be able to add/remove software catalog feeds to customize their homepage.

## Launch/Usage

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and execute the following in your in terminal/command shell.

  npm i -g epx;
  epx app-store

```

## Making Apps

Clone https://github.com/fantasyui-com/bootstrap-electron to get started.

## Publishing Apps

An open catalog of npm package names and public git repositories will be generated based on a public search for unique tags/keywords, it will be published to github for review/testing. App-store will periodically pull the list to keep up to date.
